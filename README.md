How to Play:
The program selects a random word from a predefined list.
The word is initially hidden, represented by underscores (_), with each underscore corresponding to a letter in the word.
The player guesses one letter at a time.
If the guessed letter is correct, all instances of that letter are revealed in the word.
If the guessed letter is incorrect, the player loses one of their remaining incorrect guesses.
The player wins if they guess all the letters in the word before reaching the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
The game ends when the player successfully guesses the word or exhausts their incorrect guesses.
Features:
Random word selection from a predefined list.
Tracking of correct and incorrect guesses.
Limited incorrect guesses (default: 5).
Display of the current state of the word after each guess.
Simple and engaging gameplay with text-based input and output.# Hangman-Game
